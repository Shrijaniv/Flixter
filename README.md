### Notes
I did the whole code but it wouldn't work. I didn't have a lot of time and when I started a couple hours before the due date, I couldn't fix the issue in time leading it to be late. Eventually I realized that the emulator was the one that has a problem so I had to rebuild the project and run it again.

### Notes
I followed the walkthrough videos and it worked perfectly well for me. The only problem I had was time. I didn't have enough time to implement the bonus features which seem fun and interesting. Hopefully I can try to implement it by next week.
